My ambition in life is to become a good software developer and become financially stable.
 I wish to be the best version of myself at whatever I do . My goal is to buy a house for my parents and then contribute to the society in whatever way possible.
I am very much inspired by two people in my life one is  Mr. Ratan Tata and the other is my maternal grandfather. Ratan Tata sir inspires me through is thoughts and ethics. He inspires me to become so self motivated and honest that no other outer bad influence overpowers me. 
My maternal grandfather inspires me to become disciplined and maintain a proper routine everyday.
I have seen my parents struggle to give me good education which has instilled the habit of working hard within me.
 I am consistent at what I do so that is my biggest strength. My weakness is that sometimes I am overtly critical about myself 
but I have been able to control it through constant introspection.
My hobbies are writing poetry and public speaking. I have won many competitions in both of these fields.
I have been living at my maternal grandparents house since my childhood as we did not have our own house 
. My father used to work in a coal company and lost his job three years back. My mother too lost her teaching job a year ago and 
since then she has been taking some tuitions which does not even fulfill our basic needs. 
I wish to contribute to society by helping other children like me in getting them a proper education. I also have huge love 
for animals so I would also like to help stray animals which I often fail to do due to financial crisis.
